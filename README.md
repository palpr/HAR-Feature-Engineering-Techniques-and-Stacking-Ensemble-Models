# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones: Feature Engineering Techniques and Stacking/Ensemble Models for Accurate Classification
This project aims to develop a model that accurately recognizes human activity based on data collected from smartphones. The dataset contains 563 different features and 8239 data points. In this project, we will be using different feature engineering techniques and classification models to accurately classify human activity into one of the six classes.
